# Pixel-Paint
This is a program written in Tkinter which allows you to create art using Tkinter buttons.

### About
-------------
This was my first program made with Tkinter. I don't remember when it was first created, but is very simple. You can create a canvas of different sizes and draw art by clicking on buttons. <br>
Unfortunately, no export to .png or .jpg is available. <br>
A modern and improved version of the program exists here: https://github.com/SP4R0W/ButtonPaint

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Python 3.7.4.<br> 
Do not forget you will need Tkinter library (I think it's installed by default with python, but use pip to install it if you don't have it). <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.
